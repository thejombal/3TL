# 3TL
## 3TL Abstract

3TL is data workflow used to assist Vizient Southeast members send and receive quality data. The processes used are for the internal purposes of tracking the destination of a data submission and its trajectory throughout the data reconciliation process. 

## 3T Folder 
This folder contains the prelimary steps of 3TL, a sort of pre-3TL. The processes for 3TL were created within these tracking worksheets.
  - **File Submission Tracker** was my first rendition of recording our data submissions and member contact. This would later become the Correspondence Table and DQR Mini Tracker in 3TL Dash.

  - **3T Staging Flowchart** was the first stab at the data flow.

  - **3TL Mockup** was the transition piece between 3TL V1 to V2. This was used as a idea board from the humble beginnings of the 3T process.

## Walkthroughs (Documentation)
Within this folder are the finalized processes documenting features of 3TL and its sub processes. 

  - **3T Staging Workflow** was created at the start of my job as a placeholder and a point of learning the underlying structures of Vizients DBs.

  - **3TL Workflow** is the bread and butter, all documented processes within 3TL.
